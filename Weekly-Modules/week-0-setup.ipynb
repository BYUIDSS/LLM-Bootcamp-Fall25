    "### What is Github?\n",
    "\n",
    "A git repository is a codebase hosted on the service Github. It allows many people to work on the same code by having a local version of the codebase on your computer, and a public version that notes who changed what. In our case we are only pulling, or taking the code from Github and moving it to our local machines so we can run it.\n",

    "There are several ways to do this, but this is for someone that isn't familiar with cloning a repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VS Code Method (generally easiest)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Press Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac) to open the Command Palette\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Select a folder on your computer where you want the project to live.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A notification will appear in the bottom right; click Open to start working on the code immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative: Download as ZIP\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to deal with Git or GitHub accounts at all and just want the files once:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the GitHub project page, click the green <> Code button.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select Download ZIP.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extract the folder and open it in VS Code via File > Open Folder...\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Downloading the ZIP is faster for a one-time look, but you won't be able to easily update the code later or send your changes back to GitHub."
